# YOLOv3-by-AlexeyAB-on-colab
This is an implementation of darknet yolov3 by AlexeyAB (which is forked version of darknet from the official pjreddie darknet) in google colab.

The AlexeyAB version is used to detect objects in a video file and save it in another video file which was not possible in the original version by pjreddie easily.

The input video I have taken from youtube, uploading it is also possible. The result video file can be saved in your google drive or can be downloaded directly.
# How to use 
Open the ipynb file in google colab, change runtime type to gpu.
Run the required cells one by one.
